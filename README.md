###twVoteMap

A python-coded twitter sentiment analyser. Uses the Twitter Streaming API to get tweets, stores then in a json file, repairs and classsifies the tweets, using a simple positive or negative analysis, and stores them into an sql database. Then we use php, javascript and the Google Maps API to show these tweets on a map with approximate locations. 

__Future plans__:
		Live streaming of tweets.
		Better, NBC based classifer.
		Much better, CCG/wordnet based classfier(sementic analysis)
